## Design

Architecture design for this project can be found at
https://github.com/exochaindev/techdocs/blob/master/ice-card/src/docs/asciidoc/index.adoc[techdocs]

## Project Features

* Web pages for make card, print card
* API for plaintext card operations
* A template for techdocs AsciiDoc for this project

## Docs (none currently)

* The project already has a standalone maven module for generating technical documentation
from AsciiDoc.  This is located in the `techdocs` module.  This module works just like
the other ones in the main techdocs repo.  To create technical docs:
** Edit asciidoc under `techdocs/src/docs/asciidoc/*`
** Change to the `techdocs` directory
** Run the `bin/gen-doc.sh` file to generate/update your docs to `<project-root>/docs/*`
** Commit your changes both to the source asciidoc and also the newly generated docs
under `<project-root>/docs/*` so that anyone checking out the projec can immediately
view the updates docs without having to regenerate them locally (which would produce
diffs due to time stamps in the docs)
