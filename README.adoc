## Design

Architecture design for this project can be found at techdocs/ice-card

## Project Features

* Stub spring boot http app with maven module structure
* Logging config etc. already configured
* Example freemarker template and http controller
* A template for techdocs AsciiDoc for this project

## Next Steps

* The project has a very simple example web page and session bean set up just to
test that the app responds and renders a freemarker template correctly.  You may
not need these features so you can delete them.  They are simply there to verify
the plumbing works and provide a basic example of a web app.
* RootController is currently a web app for dynamic web pages, not a service
controller.  You can change this to @RestController with other appropriate code
edits to convert it, and move it to whatever package name you like.  It doesn't have
to be under features/homepage.  That is just an example structure.
* The project doesn't use individual .properties files.  The projects configuration
settings should be in `boot-server/src/main/resources/application.yaml`.
* The project already has a standalone maven module for generating technical documentation
from AsciiDoc.  This is located in the `techdocs` module.  This module works just like
the other ones in the main techdocs repo.  To create technical docs:
** Edit asciidoc under `techdocs/src/docs/asciidoc/*`
** Change to the `techdocs` directory
** Run the `bin/gen-doc.sh` file to generate/update your docs to `<project-root>/docs/*`
** Commit your changes both to the source asciidoc and also the newly generated docs
under `<project-root>/docs/*` so that anyone checking out the projec can immediately
view the updates docs without having to regenerate them locally (which would produce
diffs due to time stamps in the docs)
